# My design for a laser cut 3U 84hp plywood eurorack case

**NOTE: DON'T USE THIS, IT IS PROBLEMATIC IN SO MANY LEVELS...**

You can find more info about the issues [here](http://blog.tomgurion.me/eurorack-case.html).

## The case

Internal dimensions: 427 x 131 x 65 mm.
The plywood is 9mm.
The rails are [Tiptop audio Z-Rails](http://www.tiptopaudio.com/zrails.php).

## Blank 10hp panels

Compared to the case, the panels are actually OK. Feel free to use them.
